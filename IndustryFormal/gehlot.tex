% \cvsection[sidebar]{Professional Experience}
% \cvproject{De-identification of Electronic Health Record Using Neural Network}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item We proposed an architecture employing deep learning networks to detect sensitive information in medical textual data.  Our experimental results show the efficacy of our proposed architecture as we achieve better results compared to all previous attempts. This research work is currently under review for conference paper.
% \end{itemize}
% \smallskip
% \cvproject{Detection of Heartbeat Rate and Oxygen Saturation in Blood in a Noninvasive Method}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Submitted as \textit{Undergraduate Thesis Dissertation}. Using Beer Lambert law we were able to measure the ‘Heartbeat Rate’ and ‘Oxygen Saturation’ in blood from the fingertip of the patients.
